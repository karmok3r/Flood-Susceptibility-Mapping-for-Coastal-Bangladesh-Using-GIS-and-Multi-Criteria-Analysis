## 📌 Project Overview
Coastal regions of Bangladesh are highly vulnerable to flooding due to low elevation, cyclones, storm surges, tidal influence, and intense rainfall. This project develops a GIS-based flood susceptibility map for a selected coastal area by integrating topographic, hydrologic, and land-use factors. The results aim to identify flood-prone zones and support coastal disaster risk reduction and climate adaptation planning.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Identify key physical and environmental factors influencing coastal flooding  
- Develop a flood susceptibility index using GIS-based multi-criteria analysis  
- Classify coastal areas into flood susceptibility zones  
- Highlight high-risk locations for preparedness and planning  

---

## 🛠 Tools and Technologies
- **QGIS / ArcGIS Pro** for spatial analysis and cartographic visualization  
- **Python** for data preprocessing, normalization, and weighting (optional)  
- **Open-source datasets** (DEM, rainfall, land use, coastline, river networks)  
- **GIS-based MCDA / weighted overlay** approach for susceptibility mapping  

---

## 📊 Methodology
1. Prepare thematic layers (elevation, slope, distance to coast and rivers, land use, rainfall)  
2. Normalize and weight each factor based on relative importance  
3. Generate a composite flood susceptibility index  
4. Classify results into very low to very high susceptibility zones

## 📈 Expected Outputs
- Coastal flood susceptibility map (Very Low to Very High)  
- Identification of flood-prone hotspots  
- Area-wise susceptibility statistics  
- High-quality maps suitable for reports and academic portfolios

## 🌍 Significance
This project demonstrates a practical, data-driven approach to flood susceptibility assessment in climate-vulnerable coastal regions of Bangladesh. The methodology is scalable and transferable to other deltaic and coastal environments facing increasing flood risks.
